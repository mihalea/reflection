        <h1>Hello! My name is Mircea Mihalea!</h1>

        <p>I'm passionate programmer and that's why I'm currently studying towards a MEng Computer Science with
            Distributed Systems and Networks at the University of Southampton, with a graduation date of 2019. Having
            just started the second year, I have a clear understading of the foundations of the software engineering
            process, the logical and mathematical foundations of computer science, and how to design and optimise a
            database.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p> My programming experience is not limited to courseworks and exams, having built several projects
            using a variety of languages such as <a href="#">C#</a> and <a href="#">Java</a> and a couple of sites using
            <a href="#">PHP</a> and <a href="#">Python</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I also love building and administering systems, and that's why I've built and managed my own server
            for the last 5 years. In need of stable distribution, I've opted for Ubuntu Server, but on my personal
            machines I've gone through a variety of distros to better understand the inner workings of an operating system.
            As a sidenote, my dotfiles for i3 on ArchLinux can be found <a href="#">here.</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I'm also part of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/UniSouthamptonER">University of Southampton Efficiency
            Racing Team</a>, in which we are
            competing in the Shell Eco-marathon competition with the goal of building an electric car while being as
            efficient as possible. As part of the powertrain team I'll be helping with coding and optimizing the onboard
            computer, but as a true petrolhead I won't be limiting myself to that.
        </p>
